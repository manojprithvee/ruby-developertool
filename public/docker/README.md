# Docker container for the SSL Decoder

Make sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is installed. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7435ae6b8212) has a nice Docker image to get started right away (affiliate link).

`cd` into the `docker` folder after cloning the repository and run the provided script:

    bash run.sh

It will compile and assemble the docker container with Ubuntu 14.04, PHP 7.0, Apache 2.4 and OpenSSL 1.1.0. Run the script again to start the container again.
